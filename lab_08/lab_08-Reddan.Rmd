## Import the Data

```{r}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/UK-foods"
uk_foods <- read.csv(url, row.names = 1)
```

## Explore Imported Data
>Question 1: How many rows and columns are in your new data frame named x? What R functions could you use to answer this questions?

```{r}
dim(uk_foods)
```

## Checking the Data

```{r}
head(uk_foods)
```

>Question 2: Which approach to solving the ‘row-names problem’ mentioned above do you prefer and why? Is one approach more robust than another under certain circumstances?

I prefer to read in the row-names when I read in the csv data (in *read.csv*).
This is less dangerous since it does not mutate our data to in the body of the 
code, and instead restricts it to data initiation.

# Looking for differences

```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(uk_foods), beside = T, col = rainbow(nrow(uk_foods)))
```
